# ![be](src/favicon.png) humanoids bePage

This is the source code to my personal website, hosted at [humanoids.be](https://humanoids.be). It is currently in its seventh iteration. I try to keep previous versions available in an [archive](https://humanoids.be/archive) and make sure they aren't too broken.

## Structure

This repository includes quite a few sub-sites. [index.html](index.html) is the main site. [archive/](archive/) hold styles and markup for the archive index page, then there are the error pages just floating around. The sitemap files are linked to by a .htaccess.
